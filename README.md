The producer-consumer problem typically involves a shared buffer or queue that acts as the intermediary between the producer and consumer. The producer adds data items to the buffer, while the consumer retrieves and processes these items. Synchronization mechanisms, such as semaphores, mutexes, or condition variables, are used to coordinate access to the buffer and maintain the integrity of the shared data.
